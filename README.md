# radio-analytics
This page analyzes geographic representation and performance metrics of select public radio stations in the U.S. These stations mostly play music.

## Project plan

### Phase 1 - Gather 

1) Script injestion of at least one radio playlist page.

2) Identify automation/hosting solution(s). 

I'll need data on these songs, such as length of song, song release date, band name, and band origin (to the extent these data are not available on the station page).

3) Research music databases

Start with Wikipedia's [list of online music databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_online_music_databases). 

Prioritize free use, size of database, and sucess rate.

### Phase 2 - Analyze 

1) Define metrics.

Preliminary metrics include music over air-time... anything else? Origin similarity index? Some other diversity index?

### Phase 3 - Show

1) Data visualizations - cartographic and traditional.
